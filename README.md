# Renderhive Website

## About the Renderhive Project

This project was created to establish the first fully decentralized crowdrendering platform for [Blender](https://www.blender.org) built on the Web3 technologies of [Hedera Hashgraph](https://www.hedera.com/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech) / [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io). The aim is to gather the latent CPU/GPU power of the Blender community by creating a free marketplace where Blender artists can buy and sell rendering time on each others computers in times they don't need it for their own projects.

Please visit [https://www.renderhive.io](https://www.renderhive.io) to learn more about the project.
